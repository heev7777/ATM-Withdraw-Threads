        Challenge Exercise
            Expand the ATM withdrawal system into a fully functioning banking
            system that supports multiple transactions.

            1. Modify the BankAccount class to:
            o Support multiple users depositing and withdrawing
            money simultaneously.
            o Implement synchronization to handle concurrent
            transactions properly.

            2. Create a Banking Simulation with:
            o A shared BankAccount starting with 1000 balance.
            o Thread 1: Deposits 300 every second.
            o Thread 2: Withdraws 200 every two seconds.
            o Thread 3: Withdraws 500 every three seconds.
            o Ensure transactions wait for deposits if the balance is too low.

            3. Add logging to track:
            o Each deposit and withdrawal.
            o Current balance after each transaction.
            o Any failed withdrawals due to insufficient funds.

                Bonus: Introduce an interest system that adds 2% interest to the
                balance every 5 seconds using a separate thread.
